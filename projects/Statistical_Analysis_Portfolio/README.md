## Movie Revenue: Statistical Analysis & Regression Study

This project investigates the factors influencing movie revenue using statistical analysis and regression modeling. The goal is to identify key predictors and quantify their impact on box office performance.

### Project Goals
- Understand the structure and key features of the movie revenue dataset
- Explore relationships between variables (e.g., budget, genre, cast, release date) and revenue
- Build and interpret regression models to predict movie revenue
- Demonstrate practical statistical analysis skills for entertainment analytics

### Methods
- Data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering
- Descriptive statistics and summary tables
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Linear regression modeling and interpretation
- Discussion of limitations and recommendations

### Why Statistical Analysis?
Statistical analysis helps uncover patterns and relationships in data, supporting evidence-based decision making. Regression modeling quantifies the impact of predictors and enables forecasting.

### How to Run
1. Review the project write-up: `assignment.pdf`
2. (Optional) Open the supporting code or notebook if available
3. Follow the workflow from data exploration to modeling and interpretation
4. Review the summary and recommendations at the end
