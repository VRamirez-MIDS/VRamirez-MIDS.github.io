# Flight Delay Analysis Project

## Overview

This project investigates patterns and causes of flight delays using real-world airline data. The goal is to apply data science and machine learning techniques to uncover actionable insights for airlines, airports, and travelers. The project is structured to reflect both collaborative teamwork and individual exploration, following best practices in modularity, documentation, and reproducibility.

## Objectives

- **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Efficiently load and preprocess large flight datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify key features, trends, and anomalies in flight delay data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Develop meaningful features to improve predictive modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate models to predict flight delays.
- **Collaboration:** Demonstrate effective teamwork and code organization for scalable analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Mount and access cloud storage for scalable data handling.
   - Clean and preprocess raw flight data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualize delay distributions, seasonal trends, and airport-specific patterns.
   - Identify correlations and potential causes of delays.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Create new features (e.g., weather, time of day, carrier performance) to improve model accuracy.

4. **Modeling:**  
   - Apply regression and classification models to predict delays.
   - Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics.

5. **Collaboration & Iteration:**  
   - Multiple contributors and versions reflect peer review and iterative improvement.
   - Individual folders allow for deeper exploration and learning.

## Best Practices

- **Modular Code:** Scripts and notebooks are organized by phase and contributor for clarity and maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Each script and notebook includes comments explaining design choices and analysis steps.
- **Reproducibility:** Code is written to be rerun by others, with clear instructions and minimal hardcoded paths.
- **Performance:** Data loading and processing use efficient, scalable methods suitable for large datasets.
- **Security:** No sensitive credentials are stored in code; cloud access uses environment variables.
