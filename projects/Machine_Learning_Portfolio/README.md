## Machine Learning Portfolio: Hate Crime Regression Study

This project investigates the factors influencing hate crime incidents using machine learning and regression modeling. The goal is to identify key predictors and quantify their impact using TensorFlow and Python.

### Project Goals
- Understand the structure and key features of the hate crime dataset
- Explore relationships between variables and hate crime incident counts
- Build and interpret linear regression models with TensorFlow
- Demonstrate practical machine learning skills for social analytics

### Methods
- Data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization (seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
- Correlation analysis and feature selection
- Linear regression modeling with TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation and comparison

### Why Machine Learning?
Machine learning enables the discovery of complex patterns and relationships in data, supporting evidence-based policy and social science research. Regression modeling quantifies the impact of predictors and enables forecasting.

### How to Run
1. Review the main notebook: `Understand Hate Crime/victor_ramirez_Linear Regression with Tensorflow.ipynb`
2. (Optional) Explore supporting data and code modules in the project folder
3. Follow the workflow from data exploration to modeling and interpretation
4. Review the summary and recommendations at the end
