## NFL Big Data Bowl: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the NFL Big Data Bowl dataset using modern EDA techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights from player tracking and game data, with a focus on defensive formations and yards allowed.

### Project Goals
- Understand the structure and key features of the NFL Big Data Bowl dataset
- Analyze defensive strategies and their impact on yards allowed
- Visualize important relationships and trends in the data
- Demonstrate practical EDA skills for sports analytics

### Methods
- Data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering
- Descriptive statistics and summary tables
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Interpretation of findings and discussion of implications

### Why EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical first step in any data science project. It helps you:
- Identify data quality issues
- Generate hypotheses for further analysis or modeling
- Communicate findings to stakeholders

### How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter notebook: `def_in_box_by_yards_allowed.ipynb`
2. Follow the workflow from data loading to visualization and interpretation
3. Review the summary and next steps at the end
