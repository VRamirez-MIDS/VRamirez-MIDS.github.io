## Data Engineering Portfolio: Store Location Recommendations

This project applies data engineering and analytics to optimize store pickup locations using geospatial, population, and transit data. The goal is to demonstrate scalable data workflows and actionable insights for business operations.

### Project Goals
- Integrate multiple data sources (zip codes, population, transit stations)
- Calculate geodesic distances and identify optimal pickup locations
- Use graph analytics (Neo4j) and SQL for spatial queries
- Visualize results with Google Maps and matplotlib
- Showcase practical data engineering skills for real-world logistics

### Methods
- Data extraction, cleaning, and integration (Postgres, Python, Neo4j)
- Geodesic calculations and bounding box logic
- SQL queries for population and location analysis
- Graph algorithms for shortest path and centrality
- Interactive mapping and heatmaps

### Why Data Engineering?
Data engineering enables scalable, reproducible, and robust analysis of complex datasets. Integrating geospatial and population data with transit networks supports evidence-based decisions for store placement and customer service.

### How to Run
1. Review the main notebook: `Store Location Recommendations/presentation_codes.ipynb`
2. (Optional) Explore supporting data and code modules in the project folder
3. Follow the workflow from data integration to spatial analysis and visualization
4. Review the summary and recommendations at the end
